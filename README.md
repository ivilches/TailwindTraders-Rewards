# Deploy to Azure

There are two scenarios to deploy this project into Azure:
1. As a standalone PaaS in Azure. Adding the rewards web as an application service.
2. As part of the TailwindTraders-Backend project (as services inside an AKS equal or newer than 1.14). Adding the rewards web as a Windows container inside AKS.



For the scenario you have to follow the TailwindTraders-Backend [deployment instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/TailwindTraders-Backend/blob/master/Documents/Azure-Deployment.md).

Deploy TT Rewards ARM template.

We have added an ARM template so you can automate the creation of the resources required for this app.

# Data initial migration and seeding
Previously to launch for first time the application you must create a Database in SQL Server named `rewardsdb` and execute the sql script `Source\SQLScripts\CreateTablesAndPopulate.sql`, in order to create the needed tables and seeding with the required data.

# Demo Script

You can find a [demo script](https://github.com/Microsoft/TailwindTraders/tree/master/Documents/DemoScripts/Modernizing%20.NET%20Apps#modernizing-net-apps) with the walkthroughs once you have deployed the Azure resources and cloned the source code of this repository.
