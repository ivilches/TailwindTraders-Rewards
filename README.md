# Deploy to Azure

We have added an ARM template so you can automate the creation of the resources required for this app. 

[Azure Deployment documentation](./Documents/Azure-Deployment.md)

# Data initial migration and seeding
Previously to launch for first time the application you must create a Database in SQL Server named `rewardsdb` and execute the sql script `Source\SQLScripts\CreateTablesAndPopulate.sql`, in order to create the needed tables and seeding with the required data.

# Demo Script

You can find a [demo script](https://github.com/Microsoft/TailwindTraders/tree/master/Documents/DemoScripts/Modernizing%20.NET%20Apps#modernizing-net-apps) with the walkthroughs once you have deployed the Azure resources and cloned the source code of this repository.
